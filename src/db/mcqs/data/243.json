{"stem":"A 45-year-old man presents with bitemporal hemianopia and spade-like hands. What is the definitive test to confirm the diagnosis?","opt1":"Early morning growth hormone","opt2":"Insulin tolerance test","opt3":"Oral glucose tolerance test with growth hormone measurements","opt4":"Short ACTH test","disc":"Acromegaly should be suspected in all patients with typical clinical features.\r\n- Enlarged jaw\r\n- Enlarged hands and feet\r\n- Coarse facial features with enlarged nose and frontal bone\r\n- Increasing glove size and rings\r\n\r\nThey can also present with MRI findings of a pituitary macroadenoma as up to 80% of somatotroph adenomas are macroadenomas.\r\n\r\nThe initial step in diagnosis is, measuring serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). A normal IGF-1 level strongly suggests a diagnosis other than acromegaly. Serum GH following oral glucose administration is considered in high or equivocal IGF-1. Inadequate suppression of GH following a glucose load confirms the diagnosis of acromegaly.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Medicine, Endocrinology","_id":243}
