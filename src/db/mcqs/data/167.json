Pain is mainly due to the involvement of the brachial plexus, pleura, and first and second ribs.\r\n\r\nHorners syndrome refers to ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos, and anhydrosis. It may be present in up to 50% of the patients with Pancoast tumors.\r\n\r\nNeurological deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb may develop gradually in addition to these findings. Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and significant weight loss are also seen in up to 35% of the patients.\r\n\r\nDue to the anatomical favorability diagnosis can be obtained with a percutaneous needle biopsy. Histology is predominantly nonsmall cell lung cancers.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Respiratory Medicine, Neurology","_id":167}
