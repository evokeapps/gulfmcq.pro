{"id":65,"stem":"A 7-month-old child is brought to your office by his mother. He has had an upper respiratory tract infection for the last 3 days. On examination, there is erythema of the left tympanic membrane with opacification. There are no other signs or symptoms. What is the most likely diagnosis?","opt1":"Acute otitis media","opt2":"Otitis media without effusion","opt3":"Chronic otitis media","opt4":"Chronic suppurative otitis media","disc":"Otitis media typically presents as either acute otitis media (AOM), with symptoms including fever, otalgia, otorrhoea or irritability and short duration; or as otitis media with effusion (OME), which is often asymptomatic and characterised by accumulation of fluid in the middle ear. Diagnostic certainty of otitis media is challenging, given the young age of patients and variability of symptoms. Otitis media predominantly occurs as coincident to viral upper respiratory tract infections and\/or bacterial infections. Common viruses that cause upper respiratory tract infection are frequently associated with AOM and new-onset OME.","ref":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.5694\/j.1326-5377.2009.tb02926.x","tags":"Paediatrics, Otitis Media","_id":65}
