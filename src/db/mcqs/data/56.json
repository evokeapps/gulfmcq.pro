{"id":56,"stem":"S3 occurs in all of the following conditions except","opt1":"Tricuspid regurgitation","opt2":"Young athletes","opt3":"Left ventricular failure","opt4":"Mitral stenosis","disc":"S3 and S4 are low-frequency diastolic sounds which originate in the ventricles during filling and increase in dimentions.\r\n\r\nPhysiological 3rd heart sound is due to rapid diastolic filling which is seen in young adults, children, athletes, pregnancy and fever. However after 40 years, it is considered abnormal.\r\n\r\nReduced ventricular compliance results in a mid diastolic sound which is called pathological 3rd heart sound. If it is associated with tachycardia, it is called gallop rhythm.\r\n\r\nLeft ventricular S3 is louder at apex and during expiration. It indicates LV failure and can occur in AR, MR, VSD and PDA.\r\n\r\nRight ventricular S3 is louder at left sternal edge with inspiration. RV failure with pulmonary hypertension and constrictive pericarditis are common causes.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Medicine, Cardiology, Valvular Heart Disease","_id":56}
