{"stem":"A 19-year-old man presented with a two-day history of severe headaches. He has a fever of 39.9C and denies fundoscopy examination due to photophobia. A lumbar puncture reveals the following findings.\r\n\r\nAppearance: Cloudy\r\nGlucose: 2.1 mmol\/L\r\nProtein: 70mg\/dL\r\nWhite cells: Polymorphs 30\/microL and no lymphocytes\r\n\r\nThe random blood glucose value is 5.9mmol\/L\r\n\r\nThe most likely diagnosis is","opt1":"Guillain Barre syndrome","opt2":"Viral meningitis","opt3":"Bacterial meningitis","opt4":"Tuberculosis","disc":"Normal CSF values are as follows.\r\n- < 50 mg\/dL of protein\r\n- CSF-to-serum glucose ratio > than 0.6\r\n- < 5 white blood cells\/microL\r\n- Lactate concentration < 3.5 mEq\/L\r\n\r\nIn the setting of unexplained fever and headache, some findings in CSF analysis may strongly suggest bacterial meningitis. A white blood cell count of 1000 to 5000\/microL (range of <100 to >10,000) with a percentage of neutrophils usually greater than 80 percent, protein of >200 mg\/dL, and glucose <40 mg\/dL (with a CSF to serum glucose ratio of \u22640.4) are usual findings in bacterial meningitis. In addition, gram stain and CSF culture will also help to differentiate and identify the organisms.\r\n\r\nIn GBS, the acute phase is characterized by the presence of elevated CSF proteins and normal WBC. This is also referred to as albuminocytologic dissociation. The increase in CSF proteins is thought to be due to inflammation of nerve roots.\r\n\r\nIn typical tuberculous meningitis, there is elevated WBC with predominantly lymphocytes and high proteins. The glucose level is also low. However, after the first 2-3 weeks, the typical CSF picture might change.","ref":"UpToDate and Medscape","tags":"Infectious Diseases, Medicine","_id":225}
