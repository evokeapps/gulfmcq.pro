{"stem":"During a routine visit of a healthy 45-year-old woman, you note approximately 1 cm erosive ulceration on the lower portion of the ectocervix. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?","opt1":"Punch biopsy of the lesion","opt2":"Viral cultures of the lesion for HSV","opt3":"Pap smear","opt4":"Cold knife conization of the cervix","disc":"In a visible lesion like this, the next most appropriate step is to do a biopsy, even though it can be a herpetic lesion. A pap smear is a screening test and will not be conclusive for a macroscopic lesion in a significant number of cases. Therefore biopsy should be performed regardless of the cytology findings in any abnormal lesion.\r\n\r\nCold knife conization is performed for lesions which are found to be microinvasive during the initial biopsy.","ref":"Medscape","tags":"Gynecology","_id":235}
