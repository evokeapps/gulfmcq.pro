{"stem":"A couple has come for genetic counseling. The male partner has hemophilia whilst the female partner has been screened and shown to be a carrier. What is the chance of a future child having hemophilia?","opt1":"25% if male child and 0% if female child","opt2":"50%","opt3":"100% if male child and 0% if female child","opt4":"50% if male child and 0% if female child","disc":"Both Hemophilia A and B are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.\r\n\r\nIn an X-linked recessive pattern, only males are affected. Affected males can have unaffected males and carrier daughters. Therefore, only females can transmit the condition.\r\n\r\nEach male child of a heterozygous female (carrier) has a 50% chance of being affected and each female child has a 50% chance of being a carrier.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Genetics","_id":213}
