{"stem":"A child presented with decreased hearing for a 1-year duration. He has been having recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. On examination, there is adenoid hypertrophy and fluid behind the ear drum. In addition to adenoidectomy, which of the following is required?","opt1":"Myringotomy","opt2":"Grommet tube insertion","opt3":"Antibiotics","opt4":"None","disc":"Otitis media with effusion is when there is middle ear fluid without features of inflammation. Up to 40% of the children may have recurrent episodes.\r\n\r\nTreatment aims to prevent recurrence (in this case by doing adenoidectomy) and prevent complications. In this child due to the hearing loss, he is at high risk of developmental problems such as speech, learning, and language. Therefore it warrants a tympanostomy tube insertion (grommet) which will drain the middle ear fluid and effectively resolve the conducting type of hearing loss.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"ENT, Otitis Media with Effusion","_id":184}
