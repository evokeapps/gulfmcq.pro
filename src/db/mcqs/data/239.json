{"stem":"A 45-year-old female has hypertension which is poorly controlled with 4 antihypertensives. A USS shows a 4cm suprarenal mass. Which of the following is the most suitable antihypertensive until the proper diagnosis is established and treated?","opt1":"Alpha blocker","opt2":"Beta blocker","opt3":"ACE inhibitors","opt4":"Calcium channel blockers","disc":"Pheochromocytoma is symptomatic in approximately 50% of the patients but it may also present as an incidental finding during an ultrasound scan. As seen in this patient, resistant hypertension can be seen in up to half of the patients. The classic triad of symptoms are sweating, tachycardia, and episodic headaches.\r\n\r\nAll patients should undergo resection after the proper diagnosis is established and localized. However, before the surgery, they should be medically prepared. Controlling the blood pressure is crucial to prevent intraoperative complications and agents which may provoke a catecholamine paroxysm should be avoided. (e.g. beta-adrenergic agents without alpha blockage, metoclopramide, glucagon)\r\n\r\nAlpha-adrenergic antagonists (e.g. Phenoxybenzamine) are given 10-14 days prior to surgery to normalize the blood pressure. Longer durations may be required in patients who had resistant hypertension. After establishing alpha blockage, a beta-adrenergic antagonist is started 3-4 days prior to surgery.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Medicine, Endocrinology","_id":239}
