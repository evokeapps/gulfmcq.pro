Posterior urethral damage occurs in a setting of significant pelvic fracture. Important clinical signs include blood at meatus, inability to void, or high riding prostate on digital rectal examination.\n\nSignificant pelvic fractures can make the patient hemodynamically unstable. Therefore measures should be taken to stabilize the patient before attempting to manage the urethral injury. However, regardless of the definitive management of the urethral injury, it is important to establish the urine drainage via a suprapublic tube (SPT).","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Urology, Emergency Medicine, Pelvic Fracture","_id":28}
