{"id":97,"stem":"A 50-year-old male is presented with clinical features of anaemia. Complete blood count showed high Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV). Lab reports showed low iron levels and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The blood picture did not reveal any megaloblasts. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","opt1":"B12 deficiency","opt2":"Folate deficiency","opt3":"Alcoholism","opt4":"Iron deficiency","disc":"Macrocytic anaemia is characterized by high MCV. Reticulocytes are typically low. Common causes include:\r\n- B12 and\/or folate deficiency\r\n- Sideroblastic anaemia\r\n- Alcoholism\r\n- Antimetabolite medications\r\n- Liver disease or hypothyroidism\r\n- Medications (phenytoin)\r\n- Myelodysplastic syndromes\r\n\r\nThe presence of megaloblasts (hypersegmented neutrophils) suggests B12\/folate deficiency or antimetabolite medication such as azathioprine, 6-MP, or hydroxyurea.\r\n\r\nIron deficiency classically causes microcytic anaemia. Therefore the answer is alcoholism.","ref":"MTB Step 2","tags":"Medicine, Haematology, Anemia, Macrocytic Anemia","_id":97}
