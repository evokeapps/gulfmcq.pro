{"stem":"A 30-year-old G2P1 at 32 weeks of gestation is complaining of severe itching. No history of fever or vomiting. Although she is icteric, the rest of the examination is unremarkable.\r\n\r\nLaboratory studies reveal a normal complete blood count with normal platelets. The glucose level and serum creatinine levels are also within normal ranges. Transaminase levels are normal with a bilirubin level of 68.4 \u03bcmol\/L.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","opt1":"Acute viral hepatitis","opt2":"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy","opt3":"Acute fatty liver of pregnancy","opt4":"Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP)","disc":"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is rare and usually presents in the 3rd trimester. The majority of the patients have pruritus only but they may also present with icterus. There can be a minimal elevation in transaminases and bilirubin can be elevated. (<85umol\/L). Occasionally, triglyceride and cholesterol levels can be elevated. It is important to identify it early as it can be associated with prematurity, fetal respiratory distress (bile acids entering the lungs), and increased perinatal mortality. Bile acid levels >40 umol\/L are associated with adverse fetal outcomes.\r\n\r\nPUPPP also presents with pruritis (more severe) in pregnancy. However, jaundice and liver function abnormalities are absent in PUPPP.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Obstetrics","_id":233}
