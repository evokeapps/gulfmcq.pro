Paranasal sinus infection accounted for 30%-50% of the cases. Otitis media (5%) and mastoiditis (secondarily cause inferior temporal lobe and cerebellar brain abscesses), infection from frontal or ethmoid sinuses spread to the frontal lobes, and dental infection usually causes frontal lobar abscesses. Facial trauma, even from neurosurgical procedures, can result in necrotic tissue, and brain abscesses have been reported afterwards. Metal fragments or other foreign bodies left in the brain parenchyma can also serve as a nidus for infection.","ref":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK441841\/","tags":"Surgery, Brain Abscess, Sinusitis","_id":92}
