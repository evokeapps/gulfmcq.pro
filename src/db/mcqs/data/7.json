{"id":7,"stem":"A 45-year-old patient presents with dysphagia for both liquids and solids. There is associated frequent regurgitation and chest pain. \n\nWhich of the following has the highest diagnostic value?","opt1":"Barium swallow","opt2":"Oesophageal manometry","opt3":"Upper GI endoscopy","opt4":"Response to a course of PPIs","disc":"In achalasia, there is a progressive degeneration of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. It results in the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. \n\nIt is characterized by dysphagia for solids and liquids. In contrast, obstructive lesions cause dysphagia initially for solids (when the lumen is narrower than 13mm) and then for liquids. There is frequent regurgitation and heartburn with associated chest pain which is resistant to a trial of PPIs.\n\nOesophageal manometry is required to establish the diagnosis. A barium swallow will show a dilated upper esophagus with a bird beak appearance. Upper GI endoscopic findings include retained food particles in the upper esophagus and resistance in the lower esophagus.\n\nPatients with achalasia are at higher risk for developing oesophageal carcinoma.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Surgery, Dysphagia","_id":7}
