{"stem":"In a patient who has had rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis, the diameter of the valve was found to be less than 1cm. In order to maintain cardiac output, which of the following will be an expected finding?","opt1":"Left atrial hypertrophy and deceased pulmonary pressure","opt2":"Left atrial hypertrophy and dilatation","opt3":"Right ventricular hypertrophy and deceased pulmonary pressure","opt4":"Right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation","disc":"Many patients with severe mitral stenosis do not notice symptoms due to the slow progression of the disease and reduced physical activity. They can present with exertional dyspnea and reduced exercise tolerance.\r\n\r\nInitially, there will be remodeling of the left ventricle including myocardial hypertrophy and interstitial disease. Pulmonary hypertension will develop over time due to chronic pressure effet.\r\n\r\nThe resulting chronic pulmonary hypertension leads to right atrial hypertrophy and enlargement. It will eventually lead to right-sided heart failure.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Rheumatic Heart Disease, Mitral Stenosis","_id":186}
