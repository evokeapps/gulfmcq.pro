{"stem":"A patient who was on risperidone for schizophrenia for the last year was brought in with lip-smacking, grimaced face, and rapid hand and foot movements. He does not have a history of preceding fever or headache. Which of the following is the most likely cause?","opt1":"Tardive dyskinesia","opt2":"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome","opt3":"Intracranial hemorrhage","opt4":"Meningitis","disc":"Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder associated with the long-term use of dopamine antagonists. Common agents include first-generation antipsychotics and metoclopramide.\r\n\r\nGenerally, medications ending with -done (risperidone, etc.) have an increased risk of movement disorders and cardiac conduction problems. Among them, risperidone has a greater incidence.\r\n\r\nThe onset of symptoms is usually rare before 6 months of use.\r\n\r\nThe most common symptom is perioral movements and abnormal involuntary movements of the head, limb, and trunk are also seen.\r\n\r\nAvoiding using metoclopramide for more than 12 weeks is important in the prevention and early detection and switching to an atypical antipsychotic such as clozapine is the solution.","ref":"UpToDate and MTB Step 2 CK","tags":"Neurology, Psychiatry, Medicine","_id":206}
