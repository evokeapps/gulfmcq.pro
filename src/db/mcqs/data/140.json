In addition, severe hypokalemia, alkali ingestion, and hyperaldosteronism can also give rise to this condition.\n\nAt the initial stage, urine will contain more bicarbonate ions, and as a result, urine will be alkaline. Later, the bicarbonate excretion seizes and the urine becomes acidic (paradoxical aciduria).","ref":"https:\/\/jasn.asnjournals.org\/content\/11\/2\/369","tags":"Medicine, Metabolic Acidosis","_id":140}
