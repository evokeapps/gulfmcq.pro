{"stem":"How long will the troponin levels last following myocardial infarction in a patient with normal renal functions?","opt1":">72 hours","opt2":"48 hours","opt3":"24 hours","opt4":"12 hours","disc":"There is a basal level of troponin level due to normal turnover of cardiac muscle.\r\n\r\nFollowing 2-3 hours after myocardial infarction, there is a rise of troponin above the 99th percentile. It reaches a peak around 12-48 hours. Then it will begin to fall to the normal level during the next 4-10 days.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is important to distinguish from other causes of high troponin.","ref":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK507805\/","tags":"Cardiology, Myocardial Infarction","_id":154}
