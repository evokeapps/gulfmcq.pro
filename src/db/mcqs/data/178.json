Commonly affected children are between 3 and 12 years of age (peak between 5 and 7 years). It may affect both hip joints in 1\/5 of patients. Males are more commonly affected than females.\r\n\r\nAffected children often present with a limp and Trendelenburg gate. Pain can be mild and movements are restricted for internal rotation and abduction. There may be disuse atrophy in the thighs and buttocks.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and initial radiographs may be normal.\r\n\r\nManagement includes non-weight-bearing and referral to an experienced orthopedic surgeon. Surgical or splinting is required to maintain the femoral head within the acetabulum.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Orthopedics","_id":178}
