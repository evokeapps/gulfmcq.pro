{"stem":"A 28-year-old male presented with a 2-hour history of rapid palpitations. He feels light-headed but otherwise okay. On examination, pulse rate is 170 BPM and blood pressure is 100\/68mmHg. He has had 2 similar episodes in the past which have resolved spontaneously.\r\n\r\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?","opt1":"Supraventricular tachycardia","opt2":"Ventricular tachycardia","opt3":"Atrial fibrillation","opt4":"Ventricular fibrillation","disc":"Supraventricular tachycardia is a dysrhythmia originating at or above the AV node. It is a narrow complex tachycardia. Paroxysmal SVT is characterized by intermittent SVT without any provoking factors which usually results in heart rates ~160 BPM.\r\n\r\nFemales are at a higher risk of developing SVT and it is the most common dysrhythmia in infants and children.\r\n\r\nPatients can present with palpitations, lightheadedness, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. Some may be asymptomatic (detected during screening).\r\n\r\nIt is important to establish whether the patient is hemodynamically stable before deciding on the treatment.","ref":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK441972\/","tags":"Cardiology, Arrhythmia","_id":166}
