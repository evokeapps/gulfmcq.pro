{"stem":"A 34-year-old woman is admitted to the Emergency Department following a collapse. The EKG shows a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Which one of the following is not associated with an increased risk of developing torsades de pointes?","opt1":"Tricyclic antidepressants","opt2":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage","opt3":"Hypercalcemia","opt4":"Romano-Ward syndrome","disc":"Long QT syndromes are disorders of myocardial repolarization characterized by prolonged QT intervals (normal - 400ms). They predispose to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes (a life-threatening arrhythmia: atypical, rapid, and bizarre form of ventricular tachycardia characterized by a continuously changing axis of polymorphic QRS morphologies).\r\n\r\nThe clinical presentation is usually with syncope, palpitations, seizures, and cardiac arrest\/death.\r\n\r\nThey can be either congenital or acquired. Congenital causes may predispose one to have acquired abnormalities in repolarization.\r\n\r\nCongenital causes:\r\n- Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome\r\n- Romano-Ward syndrome\r\n\r\nAcquired causes:\r\n- Metabolic - Hypocalcemia, Hypokalemia, Hypomagnesemia, Starvation\r\n- Bradyarrhythmias - Sinus Nord dysfunction, AV block\r\n- Antiinfective medications - Antimalarials, Azole antifungals, Fluoroquinolones, Antiretrovirals, Macrolides, Metronidazole\r\n- Psychotropic medications - Antipsychotics, Tricyclics, Some SSRIS\r\n- Others - Myocardial ischemia, Intracranial disease, Hypothermia, Toxins (organophosphates)","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Cardiology","_id":212}
