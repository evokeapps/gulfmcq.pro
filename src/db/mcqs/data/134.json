It causes a low-pitched husky voice mostly in middle-aged females. A similar picture is also seen in patients with hypothyroidism.\n\nPolyps and nodules are a result of chronic vocal fold inflammation. Common etiological factors are smoking and reflux.

They are commonly seen in vocal cord abuse.\n\nLaryngeal cancer is commonly seen in smoking and alcohol abuse. Early stages may be asymptomatic or present with hoarseness of voice.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"ENT, Vocal Cord Nodule","_id":134}
