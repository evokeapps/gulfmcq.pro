{"id":51,"stem":"A 55-year-old man who is diagnosed with COPD, complains of 1 week of fever and productive cough. Chest X-ray shows left upper lobe pneumonia. Sputum culture is positive for H. influenza. What is the antibiotic of choice?","opt1":"Penicillin","opt2":"Doxycyclin","opt3":"Cefuroxime","opt4":"Gentamycin","disc":"Infective exacerbations of COPD are mostly due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Therefore initial antibiotic of choice for an outpatient can be doxycycline or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Patients who are over 65 years or with frequent exacerbations mostly require the latter or a newer generation of fluoroquinolone.\r\n\r\nInward patients mostly receive 3rd generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones or macrolides. For more severe infections, treatment should include a third-generation cephalosporin or augmented penicillin, plus a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside for synergy.","ref":"https:\/\/www.aafp.org\/afp\/2001\/0815\/p603.html#:~:text=Mild%20to%20moderate%20exacerbations%20of,sulfamethoxazole%20and%20amoxicillin%2Dclavulanate%20potassium.","tags":"Respiratory Medicine, COPD","_id":51}
