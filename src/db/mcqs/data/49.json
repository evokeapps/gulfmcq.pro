{"id":49,"stem":"A newborn was found to have a heart rate of 300 BPM with normal blood pressure and respiratory rate. A rhythm strip showed 300-310 BPM with a saw tooth pattern. With a diagnosis of Atrial Flutter, which of the following is the best initial management?","opt1":"Synchronized DC cardioversion","opt2":"Verapamil","opt3":"Intravenous Diltiazem","opt4":"Digoxin","disc":"Atrial flutter can occur in neonates with structurally normal hearts as well as with an underlying pathology (valvular heart diseases, cyanotic heart diseases, post-surgery). \r\n\r\nAs the baby is hemodynamically stable, the initial treatment is digoxin. If it fails, electric cardioversion is attempted. However, calcium channel blockers are contraindicated in neonates due to the potential risk of fatal cardiovascular collapse. An alternative for electric cardioversion is trans-oesophagal pacing.\r\n\r\nComplications include heart failure and nonimmune hydrops fetalis if left untreated.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Pediatrics, Neonatology, Atrial Flutter","_id":49}
