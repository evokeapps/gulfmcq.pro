It results in slowly progressive, diffuse lung fibrosis.\r\n\r\nClinical features include breathlessness on exertion. Cough, wheezing and sputum production are unusual.\r\n\r\nBenign asbestos pleural effusions are small, unilateral effusions which resolve spontaneously over few months. They can recur.
