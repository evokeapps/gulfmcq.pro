{"stem":"A 19-year-old primigravida at approximately 40 weeks gestation comes to the hospital with abdominal pain. She also has had severe headaches for the last 2 days. She has received no prenatal care. \r\n\r\nExamination reveals that her cervix is 4 cm dilated and 85% effaced at -1 station. Her blood pressure is 164\/111 mm Hg and a urine dipstick shows 3+ protein. She has bilateral ankle edema. \r\n\r\nMoments after blood is drawn and intravenous access is obtained, she develops a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and fetal heart tones drop to 60 beats\/min.\r\n\r\nWhich one of the following is the most appropriate immediate course of action?","opt1":"Attachment of a fetal scalp electrode","opt2":"Fetal bradycardia calls for emergency cesarean section","opt3":"Magnesium sulfate, 4g loading dose intravenously over 20mins, followed by a drip at 2 g\/hr","opt4":"Lorazepam, 2 mg intravenous bolus, repeated in 2 minutes if necessary","disc":"The patient has eclampsia which is an obstetric emergency. When seizures occur, the initial step in the management is to assess the patient according to ABC, to control the convulsion and prevent the recurrence of another seizure. Although the definitive treatment for eclampsia is delivery, the patient should be stabilized in order to proceed.\r\n\r\nMagnesium sulfate is the treatment of choice to control and prevent eclamptic seizures. Lorazepam is usually used in nonpregnant patients to control seizures.\r\n\r\nFetal bradycardia can be observed during a maternal seizure which does not require any emergency intervention unless it resolves within a few minutes. A fetal scalp electrode is helpful to control fetal heart tones, but in this scenario, the priority should be controlling the mothers' seizures.\r\n\r\nIn addition, tocolytic agents such as terbutaline are not useful in acute management.","ref":"UpToDate and Medscape","tags":"Obstetrics","_id":234}
