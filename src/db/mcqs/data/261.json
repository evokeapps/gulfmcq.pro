Therefore, the establishment of a secure airway is the first and most important step for this patient.\r\n\r\nSyrup of ipecac should not be used in comatose patients. Although, gastric lavage is likely to be beneficial since the presentation is within 60 minutes of the possible ingestion, without securing the airway it should not be attempted in order to prevent pulmonary aspiration.","ref":"","tags":"Pediatrics, Emergency Medicine","_id":261}
