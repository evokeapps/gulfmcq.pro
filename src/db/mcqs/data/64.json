It presents as acute dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain at rest with peak onset in the early 20s.\r\n\r\nRisk factors include smoking, family history, homocystinuria, and Marfan syndrome. \r\n\r\nPhysical signs in a significant pneumothorax include reduced air sounds with a hyper resonant percussion note. Labored breathing and hemodynamic instability may indicate a tension pneumothorax.\r\n\r\nIn a clinically significant parapneumonic effusion, the shortness of breath will be not abrupt and the percussion note will be dull.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Spontaneous Pneumothorax","_id":64}
