{"stem":"A 50-year-old male is referred to the gastroenterology clinic with a 3-month history of epigastric pain and diarrhea. Her GP has started her on lansoprazole 30mg once daily which did not alleviate her symptoms. She has been diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism a few years back. Upper GI endoscopy revealed multiple duodenal ulcers.\r\n\r\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?","opt1":"Coeliac disease","opt2":"Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1","opt3":"Crohn's disease","opt4":"Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy disease","disc":"Zollinger Ellison syndrome is characterized by high gastrin secreted by neuroendocrine tumors in the duodenum or pancreas. Patients are commonly diagnosed between the ages of 20 to 50 years and there is a male preponderance.\r\n\r\nGastrinomas can occur sporadically although up to 30% of the cases can be associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) Type I.\r\n\r\nAbdominal pain and diarrhea are the most common symptoms. Nearly half of the patients also have heartburn. Weight loss and GI bleeding are other symptoms.\r\n\r\nUp to 90% of the patients with ZES have duodenal ulcers and they are usually <1cm at the presentation. Patients who are resistant to PPI therapy should raise the suspicion of ZES.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Gastroenterology","_id":217}
