{"stem":"A 55-year-old woman is investigated following an osteoporotic hip fracture. Some of her investigation reports are as follows:\r\n\r\n- TSH: < 0.05 mu\/l\r\n- Free T4: 29 pmol\/l\r\n\r\nWhich one of the following autoantibodies is most likely to be present?","opt1":"Anti-TSH receptor stimulating autoantibodies","opt2":"Anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies","opt3":"Anti-nuclear antibodies","opt4":"Anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies","disc":"Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease due to the formation of autoantibodies against TSH receptors (aka thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins) which stimulate these receptors. It results in enlargement of the gland and increased production, and release of thyroid hormones.\r\n\r\nIn this patient, the chronic hyperthyroidism has probably caused osteoporosis. In hyperthyroidism, there is increased bone resporption and reduced volume of trabeculated bones. Due to increased calcium levels, PTH secretion is also reduced. Resulting decrease in conversion of calcidiol to calcitriol, reduced absorption of calcium and increased urinary excretion of calcium results in osteoporosis and risk of fractures.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Endocrinology, Medicine, Orthopedics","_id":242}
