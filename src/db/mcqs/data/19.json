{"id":19,"stem":"A 7-month-old infant with presents with a 4-month history of feeding difficulty. On examination, he has a normal S1 with a loud S2 and a pansystolic grade III\/IV parasternal murmur in the left 3rd intercostal space. The precordium is hyperactive. \n\nWhat is the diagnosis?","opt1":"Large VSD","opt2":"Large ASD","opt3":"PDA","opt4":"AR with MR","disc":"VSD is the most common congenital heart disease. Patients with VSD present mainly with dyspnea. Examination findings include high pitched pansystolic murmur over the left lower sternal border with a loud S2.\n\nPatients with ASDs are usually asymptomatic. Fixed splitting of S2 is an important finding.\n\nPDA is characterized by a machinery murmur over the left infrascapular region. Pulse pressure is wide and there is a bounding pulse. Children may present with failure to thrive, poor feeding, and respiratory distress. Uncorrected defects result in congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Development of pulmonary hypertension results in reversal of the shunt and Eisenmenger's syndrome later in life.\n\nAortic regurgitation results in a diastolic decrescendo murmur. Mitral regurgitation causes a pansystolic murmur.","ref":"MTB Step 2 CK","tags":"Pediatrics, Cardiology, VSD","_id":19}
