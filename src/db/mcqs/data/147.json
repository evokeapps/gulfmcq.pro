Rhythm control is reserved for patients who have symptomatic AF or worsening HF symptoms despite rate control. Beta-blockers and digoxin are the only rate control agents recommended in patients with heart failure. Nonhydropiridine calcium channel blockers can increase deaths, reinfarctions, and HF.\n\nBoth nifedipine and flecainide are contraindicated in patients with concomitant AF and HF. Studies have also shown that dronedarone can increase mortality in patients with HF who have persistent AF.","ref":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/eurheartj\/article\/36\/46\/3250\/2398380","tags":"Medicine, Cardiology, Congestive Cardiac Failure, Heart Failure","_id":147}
