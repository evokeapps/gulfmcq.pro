Contaminated food and water are the main sources.\n\nDuring the first week of the illness, a stepwise fever with bacteremia develops. Relative bradycardia and pulse-temperature dissociation can be seen.\n\n'Rose spots' (salmon-colored macules over the trunk and abdomen) develop during the second week with abdominal pain.\n\nThe third week is characterized by complications such as intestinal perforations and peritonitis. Hepatosplenomegaly can be present. Complications can give rise to an altered level of consciousness and death can result from severe sepsis.\n\nIt can be treated with quinolones although resistance is emerging especially in Asian countries.  Most organisms are still sensitive to azithromycin and 3rd generation cephalosporins.","ref":"UpToDate","tags":"Typhoid, Infectious Disease, Gastroenterology","_id":106}
