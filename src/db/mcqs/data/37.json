{"id":37,"stem":"Which of the following is a treatment option for Pyoderma Gangrenosum?","opt1":"Systemic steroids","opt2":"Methotrexate","opt3":"Broad-spectrum antibiotics","opt4":"Antihistamins","disc":"Pyoderma Gangrenosim (PG) is a rare but serious condition. Classic PG is characterized by pink\/purple deep ulcers with undermined edges. Patients can present with pain and fever. Other variants include peristomal PG, pustular PG, bullous PG, and vegetative PG. A biopsy is required to exclude the diagnosis of other diseases.\r\n\r\n50% of the patients have an underlying systemic condition, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (no correlation with disease activity), arthritis\/seronegative spondyloarthritis, or haematological malignancies (mostly myeloid, leukaemia being the most common). Additional treatment options are azathioprine and infliximab.\r\n\r\nNo single specific treatment is available except for a step-wise approach. Topical treatment with high dose potent corticosteroids underneath occlusive dressing can be used alone or with systemic steroids. Most patients need systemic steroids (prednisolone). When corticosteroids fail, cyclosporin is used. ","ref":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1513476\/","tags":"Dermatology","_id":37}
